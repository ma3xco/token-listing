# Token and Network Asset Listing

[![Build and Deploy Assets](https://github.com/ma3xco/token-listing/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ma3xco/token-listing/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This repository serves as the central, public registry for all token and network metadata supported by the **[YOUR WALLET NAME HERE]** wallet.

It provides a transparent, community-driven way to manage token information, logos, and network details.

## How to Use (For Wallet Developers)

**DO NOT** consume the raw JSON files from this repository directly. They are not optimized for application use and may change.

Instead, please use the automatically generated and CDN-hosted compiled files, which are deployed to GitHub Pages. These files aggregate all metadata into simple, efficient lists and maps.

### Production Endpoints:

* **Token List (Array):**
    `https://ma3xco.github.io/token-listing/tokenlist.json`

* **Token Map (Object/Hashmap):**
    `https://ma3xco.github.io/token-listing/tokens_map.json`

* **Network List (Array):**
    `https://ma3xco.github.io/token-listing/networklist.json`

* **Network Map (Object/Hashmap):**
    `https://ma3xco.github.io/token-listing/networks_map.json`

## How to Contribute (Adding a Token)

We welcome contributions from token projects and the community. All new assets are added via a GitHub Pull Request.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

### 2. Follow the Directory Structure

Create a new folder for your token under the `tokens/` directory.

The folder name **must** be the token's unique identifier. We recommend using a standard like **CAIP-19** or a clear `chainId-address` format (e.g., `1-0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48` for USDC on Ethereum).

```
tokens/
└── <your-token-uid>/
    ├── meta.json
    ├── logo.png
    └── logo.svg
```

### 3. Create `meta.json`

Create a `meta.json` file inside your new folder. This file contains all the metadata for the token.

**Please use this example as a template and ensure all fields are correct:**
*(You can see a full example at [link to your example meta.json, e.g., /tokens/1-0xa0b.../meta.json])*

```jsonc
{
    // Human-readable name (e.g., "USD Coin")
    "name": "TokenName",
    
    // Symbol (e.g., "USDC")
    "symbol": "TKN",

    // The UID of the wrapped token. leave empty if not wrapped.
    "wrapped_token_uid": "",

    // URLs will be automatically generated by the build script
    // based on the logo files you add to the folder.
    // You can leave these empty, or fill them if they are
    // hosted elsewhere.
    "logo_png_url": "",
    "logo_svg_url": "",

    // A brief description of the token.
    "description": "Description of the token.",

    // The ID of the token on CoinMarketCap.
    "coin_market_cap_id": -1,

    // ... (include all other fields from your schema) ...

    // the addresses of the token on the networks.
    "addresses": [
        {
            // The address of the token on the network.
            "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

            // The UID of the token on the network. Must match the folder name.
            "token_uid": "<your-token-uid>",

            // The ID of the network. (e.g., 1 for Ethereum)
            "network_id": 1,
            
            "decimals": 18,
            "is_native": false,
            "token_type": "ERC20"
            // ... (all other address-specific fields) ...
        }
    ]
}
```

### 4. Add Logos

* Add a high-quality `logo.png` (must be: 64x64).
* Add a `logo.svg` if available.

**Requirements:**
* File names must be `logo.png` and `logo.svg`.
* Logos should be clear, have no padding, and preferably a transparent background.

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

Once you have created your folder, `meta.json`, and logo files, commit the changes to your fork and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of this repository.

Our team will review your submission. An automated GitHub Action will also run to validate your data structure.

## How It Works

This repository contains raw metadata files. On every merge to the `main` branch, a GitHub Action workflow:
1.  **Validates** all `meta.json` files for correctness.
2.  **Aggregates** all individual token and network files.
3.  **Generates** the compiled `tokenlist.json`, `tokens_map.json`, etc.
4.  **Deploys** these compiled files to GitHub Pages for fast, reliable access.
